### What is this?
A "home made" game engine basend on OpenGL 3.2+ compatability and ragdoll physics all in pure Java. (exluding GPU side computing)
________________
### Why?
I am developing this engine because I want to learn how a game works and what is happening "under the hood" of engines like Unity what will give me big optimization skills when/if I do use mainstream engines.
